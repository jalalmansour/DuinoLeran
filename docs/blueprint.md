# **App Name**: DuinoLearn

## Core Features:

- File Upload: We give the user a super simple, colorful drag-and-drop area (like a magic box) where they can drop different types of files ‚Äî things like PDFs, Word Docs (DOCX), PowerPoint Slides (PPTX), Text Files (TXT), and code files (Python, JavaScript, HTML, etc.). When the user drops a file, it glows a little (animated with Framer Motion), and we show a cute icon and filename. The file gets safely sent to the backend, like giving your homework to a super-smart robot teacher that lives in a safe, locked room (your server).
- Document Analysis: Once the file lands in the robot teacher's hands (backend), we send it to Gemini API ‚Äî a powerful AI brain from Google (accessed via a secure backend tool). It reads everything inside the document. No matter how long, how boring, or how complex the file is ‚Äî Gemini reads it all carefully. We use a private API key (so nobody else can use it) to talk to the Gemini brain. Gemini breaks the document into smaller pieces (called tokenized chunks). It starts understanding what‚Äôs being said in each chunk.
- AI Summarization: Once the Gemini brain finishes reading, it creates a short and smart summary of the document ‚Äî like giving you the TL;DR version of a book. It also picks out main points, key facts, and interesting sections that a student would care about. We use prompt engineering ‚Äî a fancy way of saying we talk to the AI using specific instructions like: ‚ÄúSummarize this document like you‚Äôre explaining it to a high school student. Keep it brief but complete. Add bullets for clarity.‚Äù We wrap it inside structured templates and call that our prompt architecture, making sure every message to Gemini has a specific role: system: what kind of bot it is (DuinoBot, a friendly AI teacher), user: what the user uploaded or asked, assistant: what Gemini should reply with (format, length, style).
- AI Chat Interface ‚Äì DuinoBot: Once the file is analyzed and summarized, the user can chat with DuinoBot, a friendly AI tutor that knows everything inside the document (accessed via a secure backend tool). It‚Äôs like asking a genie questions about what you uploaded ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat is Chapter 2 about?‚Äù or ‚ÄúExplain this in simple terms.‚Äù We keep the document's content in memory and let the user chat with Gemini through React chat bubbles. Gemini never talks about itself. We tell it: ‚ÄúPretend your name is DuinoBot and never say you are an AI model or made by Google.‚Äù
- Gamified UI with History: We make the whole experience feel like a game: The upload area glows. Buttons animate and bounce slightly on hover. When the summary appears, it looks like achievement unlocks. The user gets upload ‚Äúhistory‚Äù cards (with glowing icons, file count, and timestamps) saved in localStorage, so if they refresh, it remembers what they did. The user can clear history using a button with a warning dialog (yes/no). We use Framer Motion to animate the card appearance and fading. All file data and preferences are saved only in the browser (private and safe).
- Settings Dashboard: Inside a slick-looking Settings tab, users can: Toggle light or dark mode (dark mode is on by default to protect the eyes). Choose their language (English, Espa√±ol, Fran√ßais, ‰∏≠Êñá, etc.). Clear upload history. See a ‚ÄúSaved Automatically‚Äù message with animated confirmation. Uses rounded futuristic cards with icons (Sun üåû / Moon üåô). Button color states change with the selected theme. The background is kept the same beautiful purple tone throughout (no color is removed).

## Style Guidelines:

- Dark Mode Enabled by Default: Helps users focus and reduces eye strain.
- Accent Color: Teal (#008080) is used on buttons, hovers, icons, and highlights ‚Äî for that clean, futuristic vibe.
- Futuristic Layout: Cards have glowing borders, rounded corners, soft shadows, and use space efficiently for desktop and mobile.
- Framer Motion Everywhere: Animations are used to: Fade content in/out, Slide cards from below, Hover pop for buttons, Spinner while AI responds.
- Modern Icons: Icons from Lucide (like upload, chat, settings, moon, sun) give the app a clean, uniform look.
- Gamified Touches: Microanimations, status feedback, and response delays make the experience feel alive ‚Äî like talking to a helpful AI in a game world.

## Original User Request:
DuinoCourse AI is a full-stack, AI-driven learning assistant built with a cutting-edge front end in React and Tailwind CSS, featuring Framer Motion for smooth animations and a modern, futuristic UI. The user interface includes a dynamic dark mode, interactive language and theme toggles, and a stylish settings dashboard with upload history, local storage management, and customizable appearance‚Äîall designed with an immersive, gamified learning experience in mind. Users begin by uploading files in various formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and all programming language extensions) via an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Once uploaded, files are processed in the background and sent to a secure backend, where the Gemini API‚Äîpowered by a private API key‚Äîanalyzes the contents using Google's state-of-the-art large language model. The backend handles text extraction, semantic understanding, and AI-driven transformation of the content into contextual questions, summaries, learning modes, and smart quizzes. These learning modules are rendered in real-time on the front end as categorized AI chat messages, multiple-choice quizzes, flashcards, and topic breakdowns tailored to the user's preferences and selected learning goals (e.g., exam preparation, quick review, or deep dive). Users can interact with the AI assistant branded as DuinoBot (with no mention of third parties), asking questions about the document, generating follow-up topics, and exporting knowledge in PDF or PNG formats. The platform also features a live FAQ section and documentation page, animated using Framer Motion, explaining all functionality in a conversational, visual style. Settings and usage history are stored locally and securely in the browser, ensuring privacy and full user control, with options to clear data anytime. Overall, DuinoCourse AI integrates a futuristic UI/UX with powerful backend intelligence via the Gemini API, turning static documents into personalized, interactive, multilingual, and exportable study tools in seconds.
